Pomo is a minimalist yet powerful Pomodoro timer designed specifically for macOS. It lives discreetly in your status bar, providing easy access to focus sessions and break reminders without cluttering your workspace. Built entirely with SwiftUI, it offers a clean, modern, and customizable experience.

## ‚ú® Key Features

*   **Status Bar Integration:** Runs conveniently from the macOS status bar, showing the current mode icon and remaining time (HH:MM:SS or MM:SS).
*   **Flexible Timer Modes:**
    *   **Single Cycle:** Run a single Pomodoro, short break, or long break.
    *   **Repeat Mode:** Continuously repeat a selected timer mode (Pomodoro, Short, or Long Break).
    *   **Routine Mode:** Follow predefined or custom sequences of work and break intervals.
*   **Customizable Durations:** Set precise durations for Pomodoro, Short Break, and Long Break intervals using Hours, Minutes, and Seconds (e.g., 1h 30m 0s).
*   **Routine Management:**
    *   Comes with standard routines (e.g., "Standard Pomodoro (4x)", "Pomodoro -> Short Break").
    *   Create, edit, and delete your own custom work/break routines via the Settings panel.

    *   Clean popover window accessible from the status bar.

    *   Dynamic background gradients matching the current timer mode.

    *   Standard Start/Pause functionality.
    *   **Smart Reset/Skip Button:**
        *   **Skip:** Skips the current interval when the timer is running (with a subtle press animation).
        *   **Soft Reset (Tap):** Resets the timer for the *current* interval/step when paused.
        *   **Hard Reset (Long Press):** Hold the reset button for ~1 second to reset the *entire* current routine or cycle sequence (includes a satisfying animated outline and completion pop).
        *   **Header Animation:** Visual feedback in the header when a full (hard) reset occurs.
*   **Customization Options:**
    *   **Appearance:** Light, Dark, or System theme.
    *   **Icons:** Customize the status bar icons for Pomodoro, Short Break, and Long Break using any emoji.
    *   **Sounds:** Toggle completion sounds on/off and choose from different sound options.
    *   **Notifications:** Toggle desktop notifications on/off.
    *   **Custom Alerts:** Uses custom, visually appealing alert windows instead of standard system notifications. Adjust alert size and duration.
*   **Settings Management:** Easily reset all settings to their defaults.
